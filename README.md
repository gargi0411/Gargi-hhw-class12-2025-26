##  Project Overview

This interactive data visualization project analyzes the **academic performance of Class 12A students** across multiple subjects using engaging datamanegment and visual tools.

It combines **grouped bar graphs** and **pie charts** to reveal student-wise and subject-wise insights in a clear, colorful, and meaningful way.

##  Visual 1: Grouped Bar Chart ‚Äî Student-wise Performance by Subject

A side-by-side comparison of marks scored by each student in all subjects.

### üîç Key Features:
- **X-Axis**: Displays student names
- **Y-Axis**: Marks scored (0‚Äì100)
- **Color-coded Bars**: Each subject has a unique color
- **Grouped Bars**: All subjects for a student shown together
- **Legend**: Maps each color to a subject
- **Rotated Labels**: For clear readability

 **Why Its Important:**  
Easily identify overall toppers, subject strengths, and areas for improvement ‚Äî all at a glance.

## Visual 2: Pie Charts ‚Äî Grade Distribution per Subject

Each subject is analyzed using a **pie chart** that shows how grades are distributed among students.

###  How It Works:
1. A custom Python function `assign_grade()` maps marks to letter grades:
   - **A+**: 90 and above  
   - **A**: 80‚Äì89  
   - **B**: 70‚Äì79  
   - **C**: 60‚Äì69  
   - **D**: 40‚Äì59  
   - **F**: Below 40

2. Marks are cleaned and converted into numeric form.
3. Grades are computed and visualized as colorful pie charts.

###  Insights Offered:
- Spot high-achieving subjects
- Identify subjects where students need more support
- Get a snapshot of overall grade trends
